# Sees Candy Instructions  
```md 
We want to pack up a box of custom chocolate bars.
We have some small chocolates (1 gram each) and some large chocolates (5 grams each).
Each box will have a goal.

Print the number of small bars to use,
assuming we always use big bars before small bars.
Print -1 if it can't be done.

• for input of small = 4, large = 1, goal = 9 → 4
• for input of small = 4, large = 1, goal = 10 → -1
• for input of small = 4, large = 1, goal = 7 → 2
